# City of Toronto Indoor Ice Rink Pads
## Overview
This repo provides an analysis of Toronto's indoor ice rinks and general information about the pad dimensions, asset names and regulators, and the different ice pad size categories. This analysis is reproducible and can be accessed by clicking the green "Code" button, and then "Download Zip". Then, move the downloaded folder to the working directory of the local computer, and modify it to suit. This analysis focuses on showing the discrepancy between ice rink pad sizes, and specifically, how they differ in size, and thus category.
